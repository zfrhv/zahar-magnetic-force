        # <center><u>Different Situations</u></center>

        The main purpos of the new equation was to replace the right hand law for calculating the magnetic force.

        I didnt compared all of the situations of different shapes and different positions to see if both of the equations give the same final result,
        but i did check the total forces between 2 circle shapes and the final total force + rotation force are exactly the same with both of the equations.

        and now we will check the new equation in other situations.
   
        # <center><u>Changing magnetic field</u></center>

        ### Changing current inside the wire

        in my opinion when current changes then its another different equation of force between the particles.  
        its a bit interesting but not that interesting for me to dive in.  
        so maybe i will check it later

        <!--
        in my opinion, when a current changes, there is some charge difference as a result in the wire, which causes voltage in other wire.

        when the battery is keep increasing the voltage, the current is keep increasing.

        it takes some time for the current to get bigger from one end to the other end of the wire, so we end up with one side of the battery where there are a log of electrons, and the other side has a lot less electrons.

        and then as we go over the wire from one end to the other, the amount of charge is changing.

        so no matter at which spot inside the wire we will look at, from one side we will see more charge than from the other side.

        and when we look on second wire spot, it will have some Coulomb's law force that pushes the electron to some direction, which causes voltage
        -->

        ### Moving wire

        when wire moves its same as the protons + electrons get some speed,

        so we can simply measure whats the force that is being made on the electrons in the other wire, and then do (force/q)*distance to get the voltage.

        calculating that way gives almost exactly the same results as the Faraday's Law.

        shortly saying, when looking on the force on the electrons the equation looks like this:

        $$2 \cdot Top\ Part = \begin{aligned}
        {{q_1}_\+ + {q_2}_\- \rightarrow} + 2(\vec{v_1}_\+ - \vec{v_2}_\-)^2 - 3(\vec{v_1}_\+ \cdot \hat{r} - \vec{v_2}_\- \cdot \hat{r})^2 \\\\
        {{q_1}_\- + {q_2}_\- \rightarrow} - 2(\vec{v_1}_\- - \vec{v_2}_\-)^2 + 3(\vec{v_1}_\- \cdot \hat{r} - \vec{v_2}_\- \cdot \hat{r})^2 \end{aligned}$$

        and then just checking the force in current direction: \\(\vec{F} \parallel \hat{I_2}\\) because the only movement that matters is in the current direction.

        you can see the voltage [there](#calc_two_circles), when the toggle is unchecked its the Faraday's Law, when its checked then it uses my new equation to calculate the voltage.

        what about the force on protons? why its not (force on electrons - force on protons) = voltage ? well i think it also should matter, but because the proton is so heavy relative to the electron, even if he will have some movement its basically nothing relative to the electron movement.

        so i just ignore the force on the protons when calculating the voltage.

        ### faradays paradox
        my equation seems to work also when the faradays changing magnetic field law didnt worked. you can check it [here](comparing_equations.html#faradays_paradox)

        # <center><u>Extras</u></center>

        1. if you look at the short equation:

            $$\vec{F} = \frac{Constant \cdot |I_1| \cdot |I_2| \cdot (2 \cdot \hat{I_1} \cdot \hat{I_2} - 3(\hat{I_1} \cdot \hat{r}) \cdot (\hat{I_2} \cdot \hat{r}))}{\vec{r}\ ^2}$$    
        
            you can see that the value of I is linear inside the equation.

            so even if inside the wire the resistence changes, or the pressure changes, or the speed changes, it doesnt matters. because as long as q*v=I, the equation will still have the same result even if v changes (because I is stable).

        2. My equation also tells that when electron rotates around the proton then its a pulling force, and when the electron falls into the proton then its a pushing force.

            which explain why the electron cant just fall into the atom core.

            - middle arrow is the total force that the circuits make on each other
            - 4 small aroows on the top circuit are the speed of the loop
            - orange arrows show the direction of the voltage that the green wire causes on the blue wire

            usage:
            - toggle switch is for the force type: off -> the right hand law + Faraday's Law, on: my new equation is used to calculate both forces and the voltage
            - inputs are for rotation (drag/tap to choose)
            - the caulculator button is for calculating
            - you can also rotate the object just by dragging it
            - you can also zoom in or zoom out with fingers \\ mouse scroll
            - you can also move in space by grabbing with 2 fingers in the same direction or with keyboard arrows

            - the integral is manual, so of-cource the results wont be 100% accurate
            - the voltage on the blue wire with my method is calculated when there is some current in that wire. if there is no current in the blue wire then the reults may be different.
