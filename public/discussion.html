        yet i didnt found any flaws in my new equation, the only things that trigger me the most:
        - when current changes, i need to prove that the voltage in the second wire is the same as using the Faraday's Law.

          my theory is that when current changes then its another equation that creates pulling/pushing force between particles.  
          but it doesnt interests me that much so yet im pretty lazy to check it.
        
          <!-- but:
          - maybe something happends inside the wire, for example if in wire 1 the current changes, then it takes some time until the new current will go through the wire.

            and no matter at what point we look, on the back side there will be more current than on the front side.
          - maybe there is another equation for changing current:

            like 1 equation for charges when they dont move, 1 equation for charges when they move, and another equation for charges when their movement changes.

            it also means that if i will have some spinning wire:

            then my equation probably wont be enough, i need the 3rd equation of the changing current. -->

        - i dont fully understand the equation. the results are very cool, but why is there 3/2? its so weird..
          i will be satisfied when i will fully understand whats happening inside the material.

        im not sure if the equation is perfect, but it already feels a lot better than the right hand law.
        - force that particle A makes on B is same as B makes on A ? yes
        - force in particles distance direction? yes
        - the speed is actualy relative between the particles and not just relative to who knows what? great
        - if there is negative part (electrons) then the positive part (molecule with missing electron) is also part of the story? amazing
        - i tried to find the equation that will calculate the forces between wires but the same equation also solved the problem with "changing magnetic field"? perfect
